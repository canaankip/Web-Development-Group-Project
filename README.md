## Project Overview
This project is a responsive UI Portfolio website developed as part of our Web Development learning module. It showcases a modern, professional portfolio layout using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5.

The website includes the following pages:
- `index.html` ‚Äì Homepage with personal introduction and hero section
- `about.html` ‚Äì Biography and contact form
- `services.html` ‚Äì Services offered with brief descriptions
- `skills.html` ‚Äì Visualized skillset and featured tools
- `portfolio.html` ‚Äì Gallery of past work and partner logos
- `contact.html` ‚Äì Footer and contact/social media information

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Font Awesome for icons

##  Solution Approach
We followed a modular and component-based structure to break down the portfolio into reusable sections across multiple pages. Bootstrap was used to ensure the design is responsive and visually appealing across all screen sizes. The site layout was built with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and real-world UI portfolio needs.

All files are linked to a central stylesheet (`style.css`) to maintain design consistency, and images are stored in the `assets/` folder.

##  How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start.
3. Navigate through the site using the navbar.
